Wutelgi! Shoot the enemy! Not me!
Waywatcher! If you hit me once more...
I've known goblin shoot straighter, elf!
Oi! Wutelgi! Stop shooting me!
That's a keen eye you've got there, Wutelgi!
Are you aiming for me, elf?
Showing your true colours, elf?
Will you stop shooting me?
Kruber! That hit me!
Shoot straight, Azumgi!
I look better without holes, Kruber!
Grungni's tongs, you're shooting me, Kruber!
If you can't shoot straight, Azumgi, then don't shoot at all!
Shoot straight, Azumgi!
No more, Sergeant! Please!
Ow! I'll take that weapon off you, Kruber!
Are we not on the same side, hunter?
Why are you shooting me, Grimgi?
Have I wronged you, Grimgi? Shoot them, not me!
Use that eye of yours better, Grimgi!
I shoot better with both eyes closed, Saltzpyre.
Grimgi! Open your good eye when you shoot!
Doesn't Sigmar say don't shoot the dwarf, Grimgi?
Can you not tell me from them, Grimgi?
You know better than that, Zharrinn!
We'll fall out if you burn off my beard, Zharrinn.
Oi! Zharrinn! Save your flames for the foe!
I don't enjoy being broiled, wizard!
Check where you cast, wizard!
Stop that, Zharrinn!
Zharrinn! Watch your aim!
